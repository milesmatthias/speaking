* The Definition of a Hybrid App

* The end result is an app that is sold and downloaded from mobile app stores, however the application uses both native framework code (ObjC, Swift, Java, etc.) and web (HTML, CSS, JS) code.

---

* My goal for this talk

* Is to get you to think of things more modularly. You don't need to subscribe to an all-powerful framework. You can make your own choices.

* A great way to approach hybrid mobile apps is to make the UI web based and to pick what native functionality you want to implement.

* Let's look at some code

* imbed.github.io
* imbed examples

---

* Pros & Cons

* CHOICE!
* Professional development
* code reuse
* CHOICE
* official support and knowledge from the official native SDK companies (Apple/Google)

* CON: You still have 3 code bases / git repos, but any professional coder has hundreds already.
